As you know, with POP-C++, you can use the HTTP protocol. 
This is espacialy usefull to run objects behind web firewalls.

We have developed a JAVA servlet to make the gateway between 2
objects running both side of the firewalls.We try in this file 
to explain how to deploy this servlet in a web-server. 

0. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

For using our servlet, you will need a web-server supporting 
J2EE web-applications. We don't specify here how to setup a 
web-server like that.


1. DEPLOYMENT
-------------

The deployment of this servlet is pretty easy...The first thing
to do is to copy the 'servlet/WEB-INF' directory and all his 
contents into a public_html place in the web-server. Depends on
the web-server, you will need to restart it to take in count the
new web-application. The deployment is done now and the servlet
should work.


2. USING THE SERVLET
--------------------

In order to use this servlet you will need to setup an environnment
variables in the machines behind the firewall (inside the institute):

  export PAROC_HTTP_GATEWAY=http://url_of_the_webserver[:port]/servlet/PopCServlet?url=
  (For exemple: 'export PAROC_HTTP_GATEWAY=http://labweb01.eif.ch:6577/servlet/PopCServlet?url=')


3. DEVELOPING THE SERVLET
-------------------------

I used the Eclipse Platform to develop the servlet, with that you can use the remote debugging
which is very convenient.
