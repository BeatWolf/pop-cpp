On this CD, you will find all you need to install

a) CYGWIN(tm)

b) POP-C++ ( version 1.1.1 )

To install CYGWIN(tm), you can follow the procedure in the manual. So you will
be able to download the latest version of CYGWIN. Otherwise you can use the
packages included on this CD. All requested CYGWIN packages are located in
the cygwin_packages. To install CYGWIN with these packages, you must select
"Install from Local Directory" insteed of "Install from Internet" ( fig 1.2
in the manual ). This is the only difference between both possibilities.
